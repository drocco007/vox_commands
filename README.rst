 Vox: Linux Dragon Relay
=========================

Welcome to Vox, a system to control a Linux system using Dragon
NaturallySpeaking.

These are my personal voice commands. The commands are received by
`Vox Windows <https://github.com/drocco007/vox_windows>`_ and relayed
to `Vox Linux <https://github.com/drocco007/vox_linux>`_ for execution.
